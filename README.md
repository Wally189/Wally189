## Alan W. P. Gallagher  
**Systems • Structure • Stewardship**

I design and maintain calm, humane digital systems for people, parishes, and public services — especially where clarity, order, and trust matter.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **public service and civic responsibility**,  
- **practical digital design**, and  
- **the long traditions of order, rhythm, and stewardship found in monastic and civic life**.

I am based in the UK and work primarily within healthcare, local services, and small organisations who value stability over spectacle.

## What I Do

### 🏥 Health & Public Sector Systems  
Designing clear, maintainable structures for NHS and public-sector teams — dashboards, information flows, documentation systems, and governance frameworks that actually get used.

### 🌐 Web & Digital Design  
Accessible, durable websites built with plain HTML, CSS and light JavaScript.  
No bloat. No dark patterns. Built to last and to be understood.

### 🕊️ WayLight  
A civic and moral framework for order, responsibility, and shared life — informed by Catholic social teaching, Benedictine order, and practical governance.

### 🎛️ PlayTrix Console  
A personal operating system for work and life: calendars, task flows, learning, and reflection brought together in one calm interface.

### 🇮🇪 Na hÉireann  
Research and systems thinking rooted in Irish history, language, and civic memory — especially how older communal structures can inform modern organisation.

## How I Work

- **Order before ornament**
- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Small, reusable systems rather than sprawling platforms**
- **Human-scale tools that respect attention and time**

I design things that can be maintained by ordinary people, not just specialists.

## Ethos

I work quietly, deliberately, and with a sense of duty.

If you are trying to bring order to complexity — in a parish, a workplace, a service, or a life — and want something that will still make sense in ten years’ time, you are welcome to get in touch.
