- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wally189
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code. I'd like to develop my career which is currently centred around supply chain and become, eventually, a web developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via codecademy and freecodecomp. I'm also using Youtube videos. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything and everything. I am new to this so it'll be a challenge for me! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... message me right here on github.
