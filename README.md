# Alan W. P. Gallagher · Systems, Web & Civic Design

I design and build **calm, ordered digital systems** for real people — from organisational tools to personal consoles and civic frameworks.

- 🏥 **NHS Digital** – governance spines, SharePoint structures, dashboards.
- 🌐 **Web & Front-End** – HTML / CSS / JS sites with strong UX, accessibility and narrative.
- 🕊️ **WayLight** – a civic operating idea focused on peace, clarity and community standards.
- 🎛️ **PlayTrix Console** – a personal “organiser OS” to tame tasks, tools and life domains.
- 🇮🇪 **Na h’Éireann** – modern Irish systems-thinking, law, monastic networks and diaspora.

## What I’m working on

- `alanwgallagher-site` – my main portfolio and contact hub.  
- `playtrix-console` – browser-based console that links tools, calendars and methods.  
- `waylight-commonwealth` – public civic methods, charters and learning resources.  
- `ipc-explainer` – plain-language IPC education for healthcare staff and the public.

## How I like to work

- **Inform · Educate · Entertain** – in that order.  
- Opinion-light, **structure-heavy**.  
- Prefer small, reusable components over big, shouty platforms.

If you’d like help bringing order to your systems, governance or websites, feel free to open an issue in any repo or contact me via my portfolio site.
